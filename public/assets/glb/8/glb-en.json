In this process, the Reis telephone was a significant influence. After being granted a patent for his prototype telephone in 1876, Bell invested considerable time and effort in defending his patent against other inventors, also by taking them to court.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/bell/1.Foto_von_Alexander_Graham_Bel.png' alt='1.Foto_von_Alexander_Graham_Bel.png'></div><p>Photograph of Alexander Graham Bell © CC 0 1.0</p>",

At that time, Germany had a population of 64.9 million, but only 941,000 phones – so just 1.45% of all people in the country had a telephone connection. In 2022, in comparison, 62.6 million people in Germany had a smartphone – roughly 75% of the population. In global terms, the world’s total population that year was 7.9 billion people – and 5.3 billion of them owned a smartphone.</p>",
