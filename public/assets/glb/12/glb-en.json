It laughs!’ Undoubtedly, the incredible claims on this large colour woodcut poster from around 1878 attracted curious crowds to presentations of Edison’s Phonograph, or ‘talking machine’ as he initially called it. In Germany, at least, very few would have been able to afford their own private phonograph. In 1901, a worker earned a monthly wage of 70 to 100 marks, while a phonograph cost 90 marks.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/zinngraphen/2.Thomas_Alva_Edison.png' alt='2.Thomas_Alva_Edison.png'></div><p>Thomas Alva Edison, colour woodcut print by Alfred S.

He built two large laboratory complexes in New Jersey, and employed dozens of staff. Edison and his team constantly improved existing technologies to make them more commercially viable and profitable. The Edison Speaking Phonograph Company, founded in 1878, was designed to sell the phonograph around the world. Edison also operated the first investor-owned generating station for direct current, opened in New York in 1882.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/zinngraphen/4.Holzstich_Edisons_Elektrizitätswerk.png' alt='4.Holzstich_Edisons_Elektrizitätswerk.png'></div><p>Woodcut, Edison Company’s Brooklyn Electric Power Station, 1892 © MSPT</p>",

These problems were also identified by Chichester Bell (a cousin of Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone) and Charles Sumner Tainter, and their Graphophon was an improvement on the Phonograph. But ultimately these cylinder systems were no match for the shellac discs of the gramophone and, later, the record player. In 1929, the Great Depression forced Edison to halt the production of phonographs. He died of diabetes in 1931.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/zinngraphen/5.Trichtergrammophon_Monarch.png' alt='5.Trichtergrammophon_Monarch.png'></div><p>Monarch de Luxe No. 15b horn gramophone, Gramophone & Typewriter Ltd., 1907, after an invention by Emil Berliner © MSPT</p>",

When the handcrank turned the cylinder and, at the same time, words were spoken into the cone-shaped funnel, the sound vibrations were indented on the tinfoil. A recording lasted just two minutes, depending on the speed the cylinder was turned. The cylinders with recordings of personal messages or congratulations were often sent as gifts to relatives or friends. In 1887, Edison replaced the tinfoil by a wax cylinder, significantly improving the sound quality. Moreover, in comparison to tinfoil, wax cylinders had a longer life.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/zinngraphen/6.Zinnfolienphonograph_mit_Seitenansicht.png' alt='6.Zinnfolienphonograph_mit_Seitenansicht.png'></div><p>Tinfoil phonograph with a side view of the cylinder, after Thomas Alva Edison, made by Edme Hardy, 1878, Paris © MSPT</p>",

For decades the gramophone record, invented by Emil Berliner in 1887, became the leading medium for sound reproduction. Later developments include magnetic tape, audio tape cassettes and CDs. As a digital storage medium for sound reproduction, the MP3 file came to dominate the music market after 2000. Today, the entire world of music can be played on a PC or smartphone. Many voice recordings are also made on a smartphone, for example, as voicemails. Nonetheless, the vinyl record is presently experiencing a revival with music lovers valuing this analogue sound carrier’s durability and special feel.</p>",
