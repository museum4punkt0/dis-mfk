      "html": "<p>German teacher Philipp Reis developed an apparatus which stands as a milestone in the construction of a serviceable telephone. In 1861, he first publicly presented his invention to the Physical Society of Frankfurt am Main. To prove his telephone was functional and could transmit comprehensible messages, Reis used sentences such as ‘the horse does not eat cucumber salad’ which could not be guessed from the context.</p>",

      "html": "<p>From 1863, Reis had a small series of his telephones made, all unique items. Today, only eight of these are known to exist worldwide, and four are in the Museum Foundation collection, including Reis‘s own series telephone. Even if Reis could never harvest the fruit of his research, his work still had a decisive influence on the telephone’s development, inspiring inventors around the world – including Scottish-born American inventor Alexander Graham Bell.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/reis/1.Philipp_Reis_mit_seinem_Telefon_1913.png' alt='1.Philipp_Reis_mit_seinem_Telefon_1913.png'/></div><p>Portrait bust of Philipp Reis with his telephones © MSPT</p>",

The staff in the Imperial Postal Museum, the predecessor of today’s Museum of Communication Berlin, also recognised the significance of Reis’s discovery and decided to acquire one of his telephones for the collection. The Reis telephone is now among the highlights in the museum’s collection.</p>",

      "html": "<p>As the membrane vibrates, a little platinum contact at its centre also moves, repeatedly touching an angular piece of brass set above it. A platinum strip connects the brass with a binding screw. A conducting wire connects the binding screw to a battery enabling the platinum contact to transform the membrane’s vibrations into electrical pulses. These vary depending on the pressure of the sound waves. The electrical resonances are then transferred by a wire to the receiver.</p>",

As the transmitter’s irregular electrical pulses flow into the coil, they create a magnetic field making the iron knitting needle at the centre vibrate.</p>",

Cooper decided to call no one other than his rivals at Bell Labs, a successor to the American Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell. Ten years later, the first cell phone was sold – and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/reis/2.Martin_Cooper.png' alt='2.Martin_Cooper.png'/></div><p>Martin ‘Marty‘ Cooper with the first portable cellular phone © Mark Berry, CC BY 2.0</p>",
