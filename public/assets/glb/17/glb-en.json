The cipher generated by the legendary Enigma (from the Greek for ‘riddle’) was considered unbreakable. After considerable effort, a team around British mathematician Alan Turing finally managed to break the Enigma M4 code. The ability to decode the Enigma messages had a major influence on the outcome of the Second World War.</p><br/><p><strong>Accession number</strong>: 4.0.23036</p><p><strong>Year</strong>: 1944</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 28.5 x 35.5 x 16 cm</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 12 kg</p>",

      "html": "<p>Developed by Berlin inventor Arthur Scherbius from 1918 on, the Enigma was employed by the German military from 1926. In the Second World War, various Enigma models were used. The German Armed Forces and the Luftwaffe used the Enigma I, while the Navy first used the Enigma M3 and, from 1942, the Enigma M4, regarded as especially secure. Unlike the other Enigma models, the M4 was fitted with four rotors rather than three. The four rotors significantly increased the encryption combinations.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/enigma/1.Generaloberst_Heinz_Wilhelm_Guderian.png' alt='1.Generaloberst_Heinz_Wilhelm_Guderian.png'></div><p>Colonel-General Heinz Wilhelm Guderian and radio operators with the Enigma in an armoured vehicle © MSPT</p>",

They used an electromechanical device known as the ‘bombe’, developed by mathematician Alan Turing and based on an earlier device by Polish specialists. With the ‘bombe’, messages could be decrypted from the Enigma models with three rotors, but not from the Enigma M4. This was not solely due to the larger numbers of encryption combinations with four rotors, but also to the German Navy’s use of special codebooks.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/enigma/2.Fotografie_Reihe_von_Turing_Bomben_in_Bletchley_Park.png' alt='2.Fotografie_Reihe_von_Turing_Bomben_in_Bletchley_Park.png'></div><p>Photograph showing a series of ‘Turing bombes’ in Bletchley Park © MSPT</p>",

Moreover, in April 1943, Alan Turing’s team constructed a more sophisticated high-speed version of the ‘bombe’. Finally, in June 1944, the last puzzle pieces came to light when the US Navy captured a German submarine intact, complete with its Enigma M4, secret documents and codebooks.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/enigma/3.Schlüsseltabelle_für_die_Enigma_Chiffrierung.png' alt='3.Schlüsseltabelle_für_die_Enigma_Chiffrierung.png'></div><p>Key identification table for the Enigma encryption © MSPT</p>",

In the Second World War, he was one of the key figures in decrypting German radio messages at the top-secret Station X, the Bletchley Park estate which housed British intelligence’s Government Code and Cypher School (G.C. & C.S.). After the war, Turing was arrested for homosexuality, then a criminal offence in Britain, and sentenced to undergo a treatment known as ‘chemical castration’. He died in 1954, possibly committing suicide as a result of depression caused by the treatment. Only in 2009, after public pressure, did then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown first officially pay tribute to Turing’s contribution to the war effort and, in the name of the government, apologise for his prosecution.</p><div><img src='https://3d-objekte.museumsstiftung.de/app/images/enigma/4.Fotografie_von_Alan_Turing_aus_dem_Jahr_1951.png' alt='4.Fotografie_von_Alan_Turing_aus_dem_Jahr_1951.png'></div><p>Photograph of Alan Turing in 1951 © MSPT</p>",

They collect information about a person, for instance, from social media profiles, then feed it into algorithms in an attempt to crack the person’s passwords. Many people still tend to use passwords related to private details from everyday life, from the name of a football club to the title of a favourite song or their pet’s name. By guessing these elements, hackers can crack passwords much faster.</p>",
