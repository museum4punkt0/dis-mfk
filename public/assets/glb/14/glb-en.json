His invention was based on the spiral-perforated disk named after him. The patent lapsed unused. It took another 40 years before the Nipkow disk transmitted moving pictures – as part of the Telehor, the first television system developed by Hungarian inventor Dénes von Mihály.</p><br/><p><strong>Accession number</strong>: 4.0.32565</p><p><strong>Manufacturer</strong>: Telehor AG, Berlin</p><p><strong>Year</strong>: 1928</p><p><strong>Measurements</strong>: 45 x 38 x 32.5 cm</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 10 kg</p>",

At the time of Germany’s ‘economic miracle’ – the Wirtschaftswunder – in the 1950s and 1960s, the television’s popularity soared and it replaced radio as the leading medium. Thanks to its enormous reach, it had a significant influence on society. In the early 2000s, with the growth of streaming services and online media centres, traditional linear television with a fixed programme schedule steadily declined in importance. But rather than this development resulting in television forfeiting its role as a leading medium, it has gained in complexity and flexibility.</p>",
