    "content": "Networking, global communications and a media revolution – a series of 19th-century technical developments facilitated totally new types of private and commercial communication. In just 200 years, groundbreaking inventions using electricity, codes, and cable technologies overcame spatial and temporal distances around the world. These include prototypes that may never have become fully marketable products but still significantly influenced further developments, civilian devices permanently changing daily life and some military technologies top secret in their own day. Today, we largely communicate via our smartphones – just one single device for everything from voice mails and emails to a jukebox and a coding and encoding module for banking services. In fractions of a second, we can contact the world's remotest places. Using objects in the Museum Foundation Post and Telecommunication collection, we take you down the road that led to today's omnipresent pocket-size communication device. On the way, you'll also find out about historical contexts, technical functionalities and how they relate to the present day."
